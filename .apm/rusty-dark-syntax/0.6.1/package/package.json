All I needed was suitable\ninspiration. How would rusty theme look like? Let's see:\n\n![Rusty Inspiration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nercury/atom-rusty-dark-syntax/master/examples/rust-inspiration.jpg)\n\nOf course, I tried not overdo it and keep it functional. This resulted in\nfollowing choices:\n\n- Actual code is a bit brown\n- Keywords and types favor blue\n- Control structures use a very distinct green\n- Type bounds favor brown\n- Comments are readable grey\n- Strings are green\n- There are colors to hint very special cases, like unsafe\n\nOf course, I also tested it with other languages, in particular: `js`, `html`, `css`,\n`less`, `java`, `lua`, `php`, `bash`, `toml`, `markdown`, `protobuf`, `sql`.\n\nThe result:\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nercury/atom-rusty-dark-syntax/master/examples/screenshot.jpg)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Nercury/atom-rusty-dark-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Nercury/atom-rusty-dark-syntax#readme","_id":"rusty-dark-syntax@0.6.1","_shasum":"58039c8644f41e087dae4d80a911b11e9b5ffe0f","_resolved":"file:../d-116231-38584-9miiu7/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116231-38584-9miiu7/package.tgz"}
