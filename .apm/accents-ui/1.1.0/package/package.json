Popular/Useful packages get some attention too, and are adjusted visually to work with the theme!\n\nYou can change the accent colour in the theme's settings.  \nSome colours that work great:  \n\n*Crimson*: `#d2372b` `(210,55,43)`  \n*Shamrock*: `#2ad574` `(42,213,116)`  \n*Maroon*: `#d43167` `(212,49,103)`  \n*Azure*: `#1e91f0` `(30,145,240)`  \n\n*Note: Accent colour changes won't take effect until you reload atom `[View] -> [Reload]`*\n\n![showcase-01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kieranju/accents-ui/gh-pages/img/showcase-01.jpg)\n![showcase-02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kieranju/accents-ui/gh-pages/img/showcase-02.jpg)\n\n```\nFeel free to submit issues, or request style changes/additions on github!\nInspired by Brogrammer UI, which I've been a fond user of in Sublime and Atom.\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kieranju/accents-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/kieranju/accents-ui#readme","_id":"accents-ui@1.1.0","_shasum":"f424e831ac785078c00efeae316f45b120e5689b","_resolved":"file:../d-116012-57153-1qfmap4/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116012-57153-1qfmap4/package.tgz"}
