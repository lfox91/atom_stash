Because why not.\n\nThe story of why this theme came to be is quite simple. In making the move from Sublime Text to Atom, I couldn’t find a theme for [Spacegray Eighties](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/). At that point I had two options. Be useful and port an existing, popular theme, or make my own. I chose to make my own for funsies. In a way, Chicken Syntax is loosely based on Spacegray.\n\nI have tested this theme with HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript files. I’ve been using this theme personally for about a week and have been pretty happy with it in a range of different lighting conditions.\n\n![A screenshot of the Chicken Syntax theme, demonstrating HTML syntax colouring.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfranklinweb/chicken-syntax/master/screenshot-html.png)\n\n![A screenshot of the Chicken Syntax theme, demonstrating CSS syntax colouring.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfranklinweb/chicken-syntax/master/screenshot-css.png)\n\n![A screenshot of the Chicken Syntax theme, demonstrating JavaScript syntax colouring.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfranklinweb/chicken-syntax/master/screenshot-js.png)\n\n#### Why “Chicken”?\n\nI own a green cheek conure that goes by the name of Chicken, so I based the theme on him. The blue, green, red and beige and shades of gray are all loosely based on what you would find on one of these birds. Except for the purple. The only reason that colour is there is to keep certain colourings consistent from what I’ve become used to with past themes.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dfranklinweb/chicken-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/dfranklinweb/chicken-syntax#readme","_id":"chicken-syntax@0.1.1","_shasum":"1aecb1a738cb80ddbb90f46d7cc76ad8f1901e34","_resolved":"file:../d-116231-49084-mpy1od/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116231-49084-mpy1od/package.tgz"}
